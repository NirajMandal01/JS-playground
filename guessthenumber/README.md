# Guess The Number Game

This is my **first ever "big-ish" project**, and Iâ€™m really happy to share it!

## How It Works

- The computer picks a random number between **1 and 100**
- You have **10 tries** to guess it correctly
- After each guess, you'll get a **hint** like:
  - Too High / Too Low
  - Bit Higher / Bit Lower
- If you guess correctly, you **win +100 points**
- If you fail, you **lose -50 points**
- You can start a new game any time using the **New Game** button
- Your previous guesses are tracked below the game

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS (with gradients, box shadows, flex)
- JavaScript (DOM, logic)
